# Go Fish and Tasklist widget demos

This code is written for the purposes of a demo and is not intended to be used in a practical sense. Bugs, feature requests, etc will likely not be accepted.

Also being demo code, the quality is a bit questionable. There are certainly mixed practices (using plain JS to modify the DOM while jQuery is accessible, etc), lack of comments, and even just generally Bad Code.

Please use at your own risk, preferably as a reference rather than as a functional piece of software.
