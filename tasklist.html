        TESTING IN ELEMENT WEB
        ----------------------

        To test this widget in Element Web, set up the widget library so it
        can be resolved properly, then serve this directory off a web server.
        An easy web server can be made with the http-server NPM package.

        Once served, use the following command to add the widget to a room:
            /addwidget http://localhost:8080/tasklist.html#/?widgetId=$matrix_widget_id&userId=$matrix_user_id

        The widget should then load and present an interface for sticking the
        widget to the screen (if approved for the capability). It is recommended
        to have the JS console open to watch for errors and to see how the widget
        works.

        Note: this uses the fragment to pass parameters to avoid leaking widget
        information to the web server. It is recommended to take a similar approach
        with your own widgets.
